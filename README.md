# PRODIGY_CS_03
# Password Entropy Checker

A Python-based tool that calculates the **entropy** of a given password and classifies its strength as **Weak**, **Moderate**, **Strong**, or **Excellent** based on its entropy score and length. This script helps users understand the importance of randomness and complexity in secure password design.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Calculates password entropy using character variety and length
- 🔎 Checks for digits, uppercase, lowercase, punctuation, and whitespace
- 🧠 Rates passwords as Weak, Moderate, Strong, or Excellent
- 💡 Educates users on the concept of entropy in password security

---
## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
(Standard libraries only: `math`, `string`)
